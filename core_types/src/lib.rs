//! Holochain Core Types
//!
//! The reason for having this crate is to have a minimal but
//! complete set of types that are used in most other Holochain
//! crates, but that don't include Holochain itself.
//!
//! Note: This is already quite big. Maybe break the CAS and EAV traits
//! out into their separate crate as well since those are generic and not
//! necessarily bound to Holochain.
